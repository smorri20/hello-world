I am a PhD student in Nuclear Engineering at the University of Tennessee.  I work on computational modeling of radiation damage to structural materials in nuclear reactors.  The project I work on right now seeks to show that self-ion irradiation can be used as a surrogate for neutron irradiation when it comes to predicting the microstructural evolution and associated mechanical property changes in structural alloys under irradiation.  I am using a cluster dynamics simulator called Xolotl to model the defect evolution in Alloy 800H, a nickel-base austenitic alloy.
